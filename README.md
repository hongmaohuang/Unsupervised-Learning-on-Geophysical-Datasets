# Feature Extraction Practice Based on Unsupervised Learning: Clustering of P-Wave Velocity and Resistivity Models

## Environment Setup

### ⚠️ Important Note
The modules `pygmt` and `scikit-learn` may cause conflicts. To avoid this issue, it is **recommended to use two separate environments**.

### Step 01 & 02: Environment Requirements
For steps 01 and 02, ensure your environment includes the following dependencies:

- **Python:** 3.9
- **Packages:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow-gpu`
  - `netCDF4`

### Step 03 & 04: Environment Requirements
For steps 03 and 04, ensure your environment includes the following dependencies:

- **Python:** 3.8
- **Packages:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `netCDF4`
  - `pygmt`

## Instructions

1. Set up the two environments as described above using your preferred environment manager (e.g., Conda, virtualenv).
2. Activate the appropriate environment before running the scripts for the corresponding steps:
   - Use the **Step 01 & 02 environment** for initial data processing and clustering.
   - Use the **Step 03 & 04 environment** for visualization or further analysis.
